#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is accurately identifying pneumonia cases from chest X-ray images.
Through the application of machine learning, our goal is to reduce operational costs, enhance overall efficiency, and alleviate the workload of medical staff.

### Methods Used
* Deep Learning

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Fastai
* scikit-learn

## Project Description
To solve our pneumonia classification problem, chest X-ray images are invaluable. These images, obtained from Kaggle's dataset at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia), comprise two critical categories: patients with pneumonia and those without. While not all data was utilized due to computational constraints, the images used serve as the foundation for training and testing our classification model.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) at Kaggle.
